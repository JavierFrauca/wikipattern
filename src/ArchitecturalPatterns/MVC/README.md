# MVC Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps manage complexity and enables independent development, testing, and maintenance.

## Structure

- **Model**: Manages the data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays data to the user.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model and view.

## Example

```csharp
var model = new Model { Data = "Hello MVC" };
var view = new View();
var controller = new Controller(model, view);
controller.UpdateView(); // Output: View: Hello MVC
```

## When to use

- When you want to separate concerns in a user interface application.
- To enable parallel development of UI and business logic.
